Instead of aligning all glossary terms in a single level, the digital garden approach lets you go inwards. You can learn about each term and go deeper into each of its connections. The Glossary will show you each link that is related to the above interactive graph to it and all backlinks. \n\nThese will allow you to see connections in a visual way, that you would not otherwise.\n\nThis Glossary is forked from [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) and we thank Jacky for open-sourcing this gem.","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T10:52:22.308788024Z","tags":null},"/term/acid-transactions":{"title":"What are ACID Transactions","content":"An ACID transaction secures that either all changes are successfully committed or rollbacked.

Incremental synchronization makes use of a cursor field such as \"updated_at\" (or whatever you wish to call the field) to determine which records should be propagated, and only records with an \"updated_at\" value that is newer than the \"updated_at\" value of the most recent record sent in the previous sync should be replicated.  \n  \nHowever, without special consideration, records that have been deleted in the source system will not be propagated to the destination as they will never appear in the results from such a query. This may be addressed by [Soft Deletes](term/Soft%20Deletes.md) or by making use of [CDC replication](https://airbyte.com/blog/change-data-capture-definition-methods-and-benefits).","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T10:52:22.312788041Z","tags":null},"/term/kubernetes":{"title":"What is Kubernetes","content":"It’s a platform that allows you to run and orchestrate container workloads. [**Kubernetes**](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/29/why-kubernetes-getting-so-popular/) **has become the de-facto standard** for your cloud-native apps to (auto-) [scale-out](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11715598/5246670) and deploy your open-source zoo fast, cloud-provider-independent.
